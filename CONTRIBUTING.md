# Contributing to Linux System Manager

Linux System Manager is open-source, meaning that you can view and contribute to the source code! By following the below guidelines, you can work with the community to make Linux System Manager widely used by linux users.

## How do I contribute to Linux System Manager?

There's a wide variety of ways you can help! You don't have to be proficient in Bash/mySQL to contribute - in fact, you don't even have to know how to code! Here's some of the ways you can contribute:

- Adding/Suggesting features
- Opening issues 
- Resolving issues 
- Making your own bug reports

A large part of creating something large that everyone uses is being able to use the feedback given to make something better out of it. So even if you don't know how to code, find something you would like to be incorperate, or even try learning and implementing it yourself.

## Guidelines

In general, just be constructive and not toxic (im talking you use arch users). Always try to be positive and use appropriate language. Please follow the liesence of this project, which is MIT.

If you dont know much about coding in Bash/mySQL, there are many places to learn like https://www.freecodecamp.org,
and this is the perfect project to test out your skills (just please make sure it works before creating a pr).

If you are considering to add code to Linux System Manager, when your done make a pull request for our team/community to look at. 

Linux System Manager is supposed to be all-purposed, which means it should be able to work on every operating system that runs linux, no matter what platform it may run on. Go ahead and look at the project timeline to see what is being planned next.

Thank you for your coroperations and contributions to Linux System Manager.
